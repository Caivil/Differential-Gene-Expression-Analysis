# 🧬 Differential Gene Expression Analysis
This R script performs differential gene expression analysis on a gene count matrix derived from transcriptomic data of E. coli exposed to 17 different antibiotics.
🔍 What It Does:
*Uses a preprocessed gene expression matrix as input
*Applies robust statistical methods to identify genes significantly expressed in response to each antibiotic treatment
*Saves the results as CSV files for easy exploration and downstream analysis
🧪 Why It Matters:
The expression patterns uncovered in this analysis may serve as molecular fingerprints, helping to identify and classify antibiotic responses in E. coli. Using E. coli as a model organism can ultimately inform us about the effects different antibiotics may have on pathogenic bacteria.
